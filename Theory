class :- A class is a user-defined data type 
         that we can use in our program,
         and it works as an object constructor, 
         or creating objects.
        
 A class is defined using the class keyword

 All the data members, and member functions of a class, 
are private by default.

Syntex:-

class ClassName

{ Access specifier:  //it can be private,public or protected

  Data members;     // Variables to be used

  member Functions() //Methods to access data members
  { }

};     // Class name ends with a semicolon

Object:-

 In C++, an object is created from a class.
 
 object is an entity that has data and functionality.

 All the members of the class 
can be accessed through object.

 Classname  object1; //creating an object
